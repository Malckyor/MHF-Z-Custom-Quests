# MHF-Z-Custom-Quests
This is a repo for my MHFZ custom quests.

## How to use them
* Download both the quests and the questlists file.
* Import the questlists to your questlists in pgAdmin.
* Keep the questlists file inside the questlists folder inside your server bin folder.
* Extract the quests inside your quests folder, they have unique ID and will not overwrite any of the official quests.
* Just play and have fun!

## Note: The questlists are my rebalanced version, check my personal adjustments repo to know more about it.
