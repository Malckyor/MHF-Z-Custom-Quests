# MHF-Z-Custom-Quests
This is a repo for my MHFZ custom quests.

## How to use them
* Download both the quests and the questlists file.
* Import the questlists to your questlists in pgAdmin.
* Keep the questlists file inside the questlists folder inside your server bin folder.
* Extract the quests inside your quests folder, they have unique ID and will not overwrite any of the official quests.
* Just play and have fun!

## Custom Quests
Road's Ancestral Challenger is a musou-type quest that I made which you can face the Fatalis (Road's White Fatalis) outside the Hunter Road, the rewards are its materials!
Freezing Hell is another musou-type quest that I made to face Teo Tesukatora and Toa Tesukatora together, it's a quick and lethal quest though!
Old Demon's Memories is an HR100+ quest that I alongside my old friend Matahashi tried to make to recreate an old quest that was available in the Korean servers back them, I forgot to add the "Top Wing" as a reward, but this is the only way to get the worth Premium HR armours, but the quest is very tough and restricted!

## Note: The questlists are my rebalanced version, check my personal adjustments repo to know more about it.
